# Automated_Table_Detection_and_recognition_from_Scanned_Images_PDFs
The core objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated algorithm capable of accurately identifying tables within scanned images,     even when confronted with diverse layouts,fonts, and varying image quality levels.This algorithm will not only locate these tables but also perform data extraction from them.
