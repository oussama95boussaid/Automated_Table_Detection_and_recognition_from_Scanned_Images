# **Automated Table Detection and Recognition from Scanned Images**

**Project Overview**

The **Automated Table Detection and Recognition from Scanned Images project** is a sophisticated algorithm designed to accurately identify tables within scanned images. Its core objective is to overcome challenges related to diverse layouts, fonts, and varying image quality levels. This algorithm not only excels at locating tables but also seamlessly extracts valuable data from them.

# **Key Features**

- **Precise Table Identification** : Our algorithm can precisely locate tables within scanned images, even in cases with complex layouts and diverse fonts.

- **Robust Image Quality Handling** : It's capable of handling varying image quality levels, ensuring reliable performance across different scanned documents.

- **Data Extraction** : Beyond table detection, this algorithm excels at extracting data from these tables, making it a comprehensive tool for data analysis.
